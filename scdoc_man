# NAME
	*bote* - a notetaking and note management utility written in fish
# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION
	*bote* is a notetaking and note management utility written in the fish shell. It implements functionality for editing, removing, moving, organizing, backuping, and (re)arranging notes.

	By default, `~/notes` is used as the root directory for any and all notes.
	By default, the logfile is located at `~/.botelog`.
	By default, the stylesheet to be used when one isn't provded with *--stylesheet, -S* is `~/.md_css/tufte/tufte.css`.
# OPERATIONS
	*bote* supports many different operations. Some require no additional arguments, while some require a fixed or variable amount of additional arguments.

	*edit, e*++
	bote edit [_CC_] [_note\_name_]

	Start editing a note in the specified category chain. The note's markdown file is opened inside of *neovim*, and the associated PDF file is opened inside of "mupdf". Once *neovim* is closed, the associated *mupdf* process is terminated as well. On save, the markdown file's PDF counterpart is updated using *pandoc, wkhtmltopdf* and the specified CSS stylesheet, and the PDF view is updated.

	*view, v*++
	bote view [_CC] [_note\_name_]

	View the note's PDF file.
# CATEGORY CHAINS (CC)
	A *category chain* simply represents a "chain" of categories nested inside one another. Categories are separated using a slash (/).

	e.g. the category chain *linux/drives/booting* could be read as: category *booting* is a category that resides inside of the category *drives* that resides inside of the category *linux*, that resides in the root category
# OPTIONS
	*--help, -h*++
    	Display help and exit.

	*--root-directory* _PATH_, *-r* _PATH_++
    	Use an alternative *rootdir* for the following operation.

	*--stylesheet* _PATH_, *-S* _PATH_++
    	Use an alternative CSS stylesheet for the following operation.

	*--logfile* _PATH_, *-L* _PATH_++
		Use an alternative path for the logging file.

	*--gzip, -z*++
    	Specfiy that the TAR archive provided for the backup/restore operation is also gzipped.
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
	Some of the environment variables that *bote* uses.

	- *BOTE_ROOTDIR*: override the default root directory
	- *BOTE_DEFAULTCSS*: override the default stylesheet
	- *BOTE_LOGFILE*: override the path of the logfile
	- *BOTE_EDITOR_CMDLINE*: a string which represents the commandline the shell will execute to start a text editor for editing markdown files, in which %f should serve as a placeholder for the filename (e.g. "nvim -c Goyo %f", "nano %f")++
	The value "vim %f" is used internally if the env. var is not set
	- *BOTE_PDF_CMDLINE*: a string which represents the commandline the shell will execute to start a PDF reader for viewing PDF files, in which %f should serve as a placeholder for the PDF filename (e.g. "zathura %f", "mupdf %f")++
	The value "zathura %f" is used internally if the env. var is not set

	NOTE: Due to the current limitations of the fish shell, the environment variables *BOTE_PDF_CMDLINE* and *BOTE_EDITOR_CMDNLINE* may *not* contain spaces inside of individual arguments.
